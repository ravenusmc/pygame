== README

  Here is where we learn how to move the image that was placed on the screen. I have also broken this movement folder up into many more files. The code will start to get big at this point so I want to have it better contained. 

#### main.py
  This file will contain the main aspects of the game. There is nothing that special about this file except that it is the MAIN file which actually runs the game. 

#### game_functions.py
  This file is where the game will be updated from as well as control the movement of the ship. 

#### settings.py
  This file is where one can adjust the screen background color, screen width and height. 

#### ship.py 
  This file contains all the information to the image, in this case the ship, which was placed onto the scren.
